[head=2] ░ Your Job ░ [/head]
[italic] Your goal as the combat correspondent is report on anything that you deem interesting enough to grace the pages within the news. Your office is located just south of the telecommunications of the Almayer.
Civilian Correspondents are part of the public media organizations, you aren't part of the marine force so you don't have to answer to command and they can deny you anything that isn't a right to any civilian.[/italic]

[head=2] ░ The Fax Machine ░ [/head]
Within your office is also the Fax machine. With this you can send papers regarding whatever you have written to various press organizations. You can also send transcripts of audio logs that you have recorded, just click on the tape recorder and press the print transcript button.
What to Report on? Here's a general list of things you can report on, but remember that outrageous headlines are the main idea with the Correspondent so get creative.

●   Give general status reports about the operation in progress
●   Make a scandalous headline about how marines act and behave.
●   Ask marines, command, and survivors questions on their favorite type of pizza
●   Record a discussion from the medical staff on how a marine overdosed themselves on coffee
●   Take pictures of various other forms of life
●   Attempt to have discussions with hostile lifeforms and get it recorded.

[head=2] ░ Tips ░ [/head]
●   Ask people questions, and prod at them—people like talking, especially about themselves.
●   If they seem busy, try at another time, they might be free then.
●   You can go ground side as either Correspondent, within reason.
●   If you are a military correspondent, you are there to make the marines look good. So try and catch all the heroic moments.
●   You can turn on squad comms from your headset to listen in on what's going on and jot it down on your notepad
